Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!
First you have to give up, first you have to know not fear — Know that someday you’re gonna die.
Only after disaster can we be resurrected.
Condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
You’re not your job, you’re not the car you drive, you’re not the contents of your wallet.
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
